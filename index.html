                    Why travel? Well, that’s what I want to share with you here because there are 
                    so many reasons to travel!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I only have to hear the word ‘travel’ to get all starry-eyed and excited.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For as long as I can remember it’s all I’ve ever wanted. Since childhood, 
                    I’ve yearned for crazy escapades, dreamed about fantastic experiences, 
                    and bemoaned the ‘ordinary’ route through life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think about what the ‘good life’ means for me and know it doesn’t involve 
                    a standard 9 to 5 routine, working for the man and living for the weekend. 
                    There’s nothing necessarily wrong with all that- I just know it wouldn’t make me happy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to explore the world, immerse myself in new cultures, and experience different ways of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The experience has led me to believe that everybody should travel at least once in their lifetimes!
                </p>
                <p>
                    And you don’t have to sell all your belongings and go on a year-long round-the-world trip 
                    (although there is a lot of value in that too). Just plan a trip to a destination you 
                    have never been to before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is, however, a big difference between vacation and travel, and here I’m talking 
                    about traveling, not about booking a trip to an all-inclusive resort.
